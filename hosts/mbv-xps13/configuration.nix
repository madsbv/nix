  # This option defines the first version of NixOS you have installed on this particular machine,

  #
  # This value does NOT affect the Nixpkgs version your packages and OS are pulled from,

  #
  # This value being lower than the current NixOS release does NOT mean your system is
  # out of date, out of support, or vulnerable.

  # Do NOT change this value unless you have manually inspected all the changes it would make to your configuration,
