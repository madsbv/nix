- [x] Make emacs work properly.
- [x] Figure out how to apply no-titlebar patch
- [ ] Refactor config to make more sense
- [ ]   In particular, put config in a consolidated location instead of splitting between hosts and modules. Actually, splitting up config into more app specific sections would probably be better.
- [ ]   Eventually, this should include splitting up app installations more, e.g. gui installed separate from cli tools.
- [ ] Learn secrets management using age
- [ ] Set up SSH keys properly, including git and gh
- [ ] Set up gpg and agent
- [x] Get Sketchybar working again
- [x] ZSH autocompletion/suggestion, zplug, ...
- [x] Get back C-r shortcut in ZSH with vim mode
- [x] Get spell-checking working in Emacs
- [x] Fix pdf-tools in Emacs
- [ ] Dock
- [ ] Set up Just
- [ ]   E.g. something like this for config tinkering: https://nixos-and-flakes.thiscute.world/best-practices/accelerating-dotfiles-debugging
- [x] Install ProtonBridge (available via nix)


Install via Brew:
- [x] Dropbox

Refactoring
